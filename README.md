# What does this application do?
This is an application that monitors the health of the Magnificent Server.<br>
User will run it on the terminal, and give it as a parameter the # of seconds to wait between checks to the server<br>
A clear message on the terminal will tell if the server has failed or not<br>
It will also tell how many times the server has failed and how many times it has responded successfully

# How does it works?
ðŸ’» This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application that uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js<br>
This is a simple software architecture demonstrating how the application should work:

# How to run this application?
1. Clone and download this repository (or fork, than clone, which would be better)
Navigate with terminal to your chosen folder and run `git clone https://github.com/discombobulateme/magnificent-challenge`
2. Open magnificent-server folder `cd magnificent-server`
3. Follow "Magnificent Server installation" bellow instructions
4. Let the server running `python server.py`(you can use a second terminal window to let the server running)
5. Go back to the previour folder `cd ..`
6. Open using-axios folder `cd using-axios`
7. Follow "Run the application passing a parameter" below instructions

## Magnificent Server installation
1. Install Python
2. pip install twisted
3. python server.py
4. Okay, now you're running magnificent!
5. Visit http://localhost:12345 in a web browser
6. It should throw a verbose error, or return "Magnificent!"

## Run the application passing a parameter
1. Install project dependencies `npm install`
2. Run the application, passing a parameter for the # of seconds between checks `node index.js <your numerical chosen parameter in seconds>`
3. To exit the application type: CTRL + C

### Error handling
You can just run the application using `node index.js`, or give no paramenter, but there will be no set interval.<br>
That means the program will run absurdly fast and reach 50.000 count in a split of a second ðŸ˜² <br>
Just exit with typing `Ctrl +C` and restart using the proper parameter
