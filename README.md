# What does this application do?
This is an application that monitors the health of the Magnificent Server.<br>
User will run it on the terminal, and give it as a parameter the # of seconds to wait between checks to the server<br>
A clear message on the terminal will tell if the server has failed or not<br>
It will also tell how many times the server has failed and how many times it has responded successfully

# How does it works?
ðŸ’» This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application that uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js<br>
This is a simple software architecture demonstrating how the application should work:
